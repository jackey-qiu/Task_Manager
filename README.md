On the right panel, you edit your task daily or on any specific date in the future. Then save it.
On the left panel, you can load the task file you just saved. The task blocks will be shown as different colors. The actived task is in red. The past tasks will be in dark blue, while future tasks are in light blue. Gray blocks are time slots without any scheduled tasks. The marker for current time will move gradually with time.
